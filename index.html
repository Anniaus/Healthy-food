                <h2>Dal Makhani</h2>
                <p class="receipe">I have added 1/4 teaspoon of garam masala but that’s also optional. You can skip
                    it.Other than that
                    there’s only 1/2 teaspoon of kashmiri red chili powder for the color mainly.No kasuri methi, cumin
                    seeds nothing.The main flavors of the dal come from using fresh onion, ginger, garlic, tomato puree
                    and liberal amount of butter and ghee.That’s all you need to make a good dal makhani.

                <h2>Sausages</h2>
                <p class="receipe">Heat the oil in a frying pan over medium heat.Add the sausages and cook them until
                    brown or cooked through. Leave to cool then slice it. Keep warm.Add a little oil to a saucepan then
                    add onion and cook until translucent.Add sausages, stir-fry base, cooked vegetables stir and cook
                    for 3-4 minutes.Add homemade pasta and gently stir together.

                <h2>Beef Steak Salad</h2>
                <p class="receipe">Season your steak well. I've listed 1/2 teaspoon of salt in the ingredient list, but
                    you could double this. The first time I had a really well-seasoned steak, my mind was blown. It
                    makes all the difference.Cook the steak in a blazing hot pan. If you have a cast iron pan, use it.
                    This crazy high heat is what gives the steak a gorgeous char without overcooking it.you'll have the
                    best steak ever for your steak salad.
